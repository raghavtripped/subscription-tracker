# PWA Icons

Place your app icons here:

- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels (required for PWA)
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels (required for PWA)

## Quick Icon Generation

You can generate these icons using:
- [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator)
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Any image editor (export as PNG)

For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares with the app name.

## Temporary Placeholder

If you need to test the PWA immediately, you can create simple placeholder images:
- Solid color background (#2563eb for blue)
- White text "ST" in the center
- Export as PNG at the required sizes
